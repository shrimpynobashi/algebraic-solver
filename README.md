# algebraic-solver
Solves single-variable binomial algebraic functions.

This was pitched to me as a coding challenge for a job interview and I wanted to prove to myself afterwards that I could do it better.


v0.1:
Currently, it only solves for functions set in the code to be used in IDEs, but will expand functionality to be used through command line.
Also, currently has limited edge-case capabilities.
It's very late.
